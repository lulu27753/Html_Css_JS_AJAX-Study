The answer for the next-to-last NDQ needs to be completely changed. Instead of referring to current JS, it refers to JS2, which isn't supported in any real browsers yet. Here's a new answer:

<<<
A: Maybe. The current version of JavaScript (1.7) doesn't support true local scope for variables. Instead, 
it supports function scope, which means variables within a given function are considered local variables 
to that function. But just sticking a variable inside of a compound statement doesn't automatically make 
it a local variable, although a future version of JavaScript will likely remedy this situation. The easy 
way to remember it is that variables created inside of a function are local, while all others are global.
>>> 

{273-274} The code in the exercise and the exercise solution should be changed from:

function doThis(num) { 
  return num++; 
} 

function doThat(num) { 
  return num--; 
}

var x = doThis(11);
var y = doThat;
var z = doThat(x);
x = y(z);
y = x;
alert(doThat(z - y));

to:

function doThis(num) { 
  num++; 
  return num; 
} 

function doThat(num) { 
  num--; 
  return num; 
}

var x = doThis(11);
var y = doThat;
var z = doThat(x);
x = y(z);
y = x;
alert(doThat(z - y));

{293} Third code block on page

The last line of the code block should not end with a semicolon. The code should read:

function showIt(theForm) {
  alert(theForm["zipcode"].value);
}

{302} Second line of code block

The code in the onblur handler should end with a semicolon. This second line of code should read:

onblur="validateNonEmpty(this, document.getElementById('phone_help'));" />

{323} What's My Purpose exercise
For consistency, the positions of second and sixth answer options in the right column should be swapped 
("The sub-pattern is required..." and "The sub-pattern is optional..."), so the ordering of the right 
column matches the ordering on the following page of solutions.

{434} diagram at top

The box with the text "ceiling()" should instead contain the text "ceil()"

{434, 436} Exercise and Exercise solution

The second code line should read "Math.ceil(Math.PI)", not "Math.ceiling(Math.PI)"
